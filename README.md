> A mobile app all about Emily Dickinson

## Features

-   Poem of the Day, with 300 poems scraped from the PoetryDB
-   Mood Slider - match a poem's sentiment as determined by Microsoft Cognitive Services (sentiment values are preloaded in the dataset)
-   Selfie Analyzer - match the emotion of your selfie with a poem. Selfie is sent to cognitive services Face API, poems are pre-analyzed
-   New Poetry - poetry generated by textgen-rnn. Pretty strange stuff that still sometimes captures the cadence. New poems have been generated locally and loaded into .json.
